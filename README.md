# Computer-Vision-Udacity
This repository holds all my project submitted to the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree and some study code. 

## Projects:

### P1 - Facial Keypoints Recognition

#### The dataset
The objective of this project is to detect Facial Keypoints over a person face image. There are several databases that holds facial images labeled data. In this case, this project uses [Youtube Faces DB](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/). It has face images attached to 68 coordinates (x,y) of each keypoint. 

#### Implementation details
It's a linear regression problem. I used Convolutional Neural Networks to find the features over the images. Added Dropout to prevent overfitting and used Batch Normalization to normalize the input between hidden units. 

I've used Adam optimizer and MSEloss function.

It uses Pytorch.
